# TimberLog #
#### TimberLog provides a reliable, secure, and flexible method of logging information about any number of items or projects so that the data can be searched, analyzed, exported, and shared as needed. TimberLog uses encryption, checksums, and sequential date validation to ensure entries are not modified after they have been entered in the logbook. ####
