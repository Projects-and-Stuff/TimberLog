The files in this folder are logbook type files.

In order to test/use these, the files should be placed in the Global App Config folder. This is usually:
C:\ProgramData\TimberLog

(Eventual Goal: "Empty" Logbook type will be automatically placed in the folder if no logbook type files are present)
